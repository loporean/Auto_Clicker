# Auto_Clicker

This is an autoclicker program implemented in Python. The program uses the PyAutoGUI library to simulate mouse clicks, and the Selenium library to control the Firefox web browser. The program can be started by clicking the 'Start' button in the GUI. Once the program is running, the user can move the mouse to the desired position and left-click to start the autoclicker. The autoclicker will continue to click at the current mouse position until the user presses the 'esc' key on the keyboard, at which point the program will stop clicking. The program includes functionality to pause clicking if the mouse moves too far from the initial position, and to resume clicking once the mouse is returned to the initial position. The program also includes a 'Reset' button that can be used to reset the autoclicker to the initial position.
